[codepen for SASS](https://codepen.io/wolfinator/pen/zYJqGRw)

** SHIT I NEVER DID KNOWED:

"dependencies": Packages required by your application in production. 
	jquery is needed for app to run

"devDependencies": Packages that are only needed for local development and testing.
	-ie node-sass is just a TOOL

ALWAYS commit the package lock!!!!!!!!!!!!
It is highly recommended you commit the generated package lock to source control: this will allow anyone else on your team, your deployments, your CI/continuous integration, and anyone else who runs npm install in your package source to get the exact same dependency tree that you were developing on.
